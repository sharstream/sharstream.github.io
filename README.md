# David Perez Bootstrap Portfolio

Host Site Bootstrap-Portfolio

### Overview

Welcome to my basic portfolio page. This is my first site written in HTML and CSS. 
I am a Salesforce developer and global admin with basic experiences about HTML and 
CSS. I am currently living in Atlanta GA since 2 years ago.

Installation for bootstrap social icons 
--------------------------------------
Social Buttons made in pure CSS based on
[Bootstrap](http://twbs.github.io/bootstrap/) and
[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)!

Include the `bootstrap-social.css` or `bootstrap-social.less` in your project, or
install it through [Bower](http://bower.io/):

    bower install bootstrap-social
